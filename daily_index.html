        <h1>THOR ODINSON</h1>
        <p>
          "Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians,<br>
          a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br>
          Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as <br>
          Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, <br>
          which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. <br>
          When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard <br>
          (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake, <br>
          stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers. <br>
          Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, <br>
          "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
